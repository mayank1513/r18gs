## Motivation

I have built wonderful libraries utilizing React18 features using Zustand. They worked awesome. However, when I try importing from specific folder for better tree-shaking, the libraries fail. This is because, for each import a separate zustand store is created. This actually increases the package size also.

Thus, I decided to create a bare minimum, ultra-light store that creates shared state even while importing components from separate files for better treeshaking.

> Will be using this library soon to fix issues with `nextjs-themes`.

## Features

âœ… Full TypeScript Support

âœ… Unleash the full power of React18 Server components

âœ… Works with all build systems/tools/frameworks for React18

âœ… Doccumented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/r18gs) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/r18gs))

âœ… Next.js, Vite and Remix examples

## Install

> A canonical package with longer name is also published `react18-global-store`

```bash
$ pnpm add r18gs
```

or

```bash
$ npm install r18gs
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add r18gs
```

## Usage

Use this hook similar to `useState` hook.

The difference is that you need to pass an unique key - unique across the app to identify
and make this state accessible to all client components.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", 1);
```

You can access the same state across all client side components using unique.

> It is recommended to store your keys in separate file to avoid typos and unnecessary conflicts.

### Example

```tsx
// constants/global-states.ts
export const COUNTER = "counter";
```

```tsx
// components/display.tsx
"use client";

import useRGS from "r18gs";
import { COUNTER } from "../constants/global-states";

export default function Display() {
	const [count] = useRGS<number>(COUNTER);
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Client component 2</h2>
			<b>{count}</b>
		</div>
	);
}
```

```tsx
// components/counter.tsx
"use client";

import useRGS from "r18gs";
import { COUNTER } from "../constants/global-states";

export default function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useRGS(COUNTER, 0);
	return (
		<div>
			<h2>Clinet component 1</h2>
			<input
				onChange={e => {
					setCount(parseInt(e.target.value.trim()));
				}}
				type="number"
				value={count}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```
