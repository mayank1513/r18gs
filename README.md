## Motivation

I have built wonderful libraries utilizing React18 features using Zustand. They worked awesome. However, when I try importing from specific folder for better tree-shaking, the libraries fail. This is because, for each import a separate zustand store is created. This actually increases the package size also.

Thus, I decided to create a bare minimum, ultra-light store that creates shared state even while importing components from separate files for better treeshaking.

> Will be using this library soon to fix issues with `nextjs-themes`.
