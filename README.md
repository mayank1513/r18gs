## Motivation

I have built wonderful libraries utilizing React18 features using Zustand. They worked awesome. However, when I try importing from specific folder for better tree-shaking, the libraries fail. This is because, for each import a separate zustand store is created. This actually increases the package size also.

Thus, I decided to create a bare minimum, ultra-light store that creates shared state even while importing components from separate files for better treeshaking.

## Features

âœ… Full TypeScript Support

âœ… Unleash the full power of React18 Server components

âœ… Works with all build systems/tools/frameworks for React18

âœ… Doccumented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store))

âœ… Next.js, Vite and Remix examples

## Simple global state shared across multiple components

Utilize this hook similarly to the `useState` hook. However, ensure to pass a unique key, unique across the app, to identify and make this state accessible to all client components.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", 1);
```

> For detailed instructions see [Getting Started](./md-docs/getting-started.md)

## Using Plugins

You can enhance the functionality of the store by utilizing either the `create` function or the `useRGSWithPlugins` hook from `r18gs/dist/with-plugins`, enabling features such as storing to local storage, among others.

```tsx
// store.ts
import { create } from "r18gs/dist/with-plugins";
import { persist } from "r18gs/dist/plugins"; /** You can create your own plugin or import third party plugin */

export const useMyPersistentCounterStore = create<number>("persistent-counter", 0, [persist()]);
```

Now you can use `useMyPersistentCounterStore` similar to `useState` without any initial value.
