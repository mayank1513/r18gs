## Motivation

I've created outstanding libraries that harness React18 features using Zustand, which have performed remarkably well. However, when I tried to import from specific folders to enhance tree-shaking, the libraries encountered complications. Each import led to the creation of a separate Zustand store, causing an increase in package size.

To address this issue, I embarked on developing a lightweight, minimalistic store that facilitates shared state even when importing components from different files, thereby optimizing tree-shaking.

## Features

âœ… Complete TypeScript Support

âœ… Unleash the full capabilities of React18 Server components

âœ… Compatible with all React18 build systems, tools, and frameworks

âœ… Available in both CommonJS (CJS) and ECMAScript Modules (ESM)

âœ… Documented with [Typedoc](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store) ([Docs](https://react18-tools.github.io/react18-global-store))

âœ… Examples available for Next.js, Vite, and Remix

## Simple Global State Shared Across Multiple Components

Utilize this hook similar to the `useState` hook. However, ensure to provide a unique key, unique across the app, to identify and make this state accessible to all client components.

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useRGS<number>("counter", 1);
```

## Using Plugins

Enhance the functionality of the store by leveraging either the `create` function, `withPlugins` function, or the `useRGSWithPlugins` hook from `r18gs/dist/with-plugins`, enabling features such as storing to local storage, among others.

```tsx
// store.ts
import { create } from "r18gs/dist/with-plugins";
import { persist } from "r18gs/dist/plugins"; /** You can create your own plugin or import third-party plugins */

export const useMyPersistentCounterStore = create<number>("persistent-counter", 0, [persist()]);
```

Now, you can utilize `useMyPersistentCounterStore` similarly to `useState` without specifying an initial value.

```tsx
const [persistedCount, setPersistedCount] = useMyPersistentCounterStore();
```
